# code-server (for students)

## This is a fork of the original code-server intended for student exam settings!

### Getting started

```sh
# clone ..
git submodule update --init
bash ci/build/update-vscode.sh # need to install quilt e.g. brew install quilt
nvm use 24
npm i -D # might need to run multiple times (??)
VERSION='0.0.0' npm run build:vscode
npm run build
node out/node/entry.js


Run [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) on any machine anywhere and
access it in the browser.

## Highlights

- Code on any device with a consistent development environment
- Use cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more
- Preserve battery life when you're on the go; all intensive tasks run on your
  server

## Requirements

See [requirements](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest/requirements) for minimum specs, as well as instructions
on how to set up a Google VM on which you can install code-server.

**TL;DR:** Linux machine with WebSockets enabled, 1 GB RAM, and 2 vCPUs

## Getting started

There are five ways to get started:

1. Using the [install
   script](https://github.com/coder/code-server/blob/main/install.sh), which
   automates most of the process. The script uses the system package manager if
   possible.
2. Manually [installing
   code-server](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest/install)
3. Deploy code-server to your team with [coder/coder](https://cdr.co/coder-github)
4. Using our one-click buttons and guides to [deploy code-server to a cloud
   provider](https://github.com/coder/deploy-code-server) ⚡
5. Using the [code-server feature for
   devcontainers](https://github.com/coder/devcontainer-features/blob/main/src/code-server/README.md),
   if you already use devcontainers in your project.

If you use the install script, you can preview what occurs during the install
process:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- --dry-run
```

To install, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh
```

When done, the install script prints out instructions for running and starting
code-server.
